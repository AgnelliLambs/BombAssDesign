		<p>The file permissions are at the very start of the line.
		The first space within the file directory determine whether the file is
		a file or if it is a directory. The next three spaces are for the User, then
		the next three spaces are for the group, and the last three spaces are for 
		anything else. The three spaces can consist of an r, w, or x which stand for
		read = r, write = w, and execute = x</p>
		
		<p>The three letters, rwx, all stand for different octal numbers which can be used
		in the terminal command line to change file permissions. This consists of:
		r = 4, w = 2, and x = 1. In order to change the file permissions using octal numbers
		it requires three numbers ranging from 0-7. For example 000 would remove all permissions
		from the file you choose.</p>
