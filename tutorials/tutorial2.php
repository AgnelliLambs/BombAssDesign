	<h1>Tutorial 2 - SFTP</h1>
	
	<p>
		SFTP stands for SSH File Transfer Protocol, it can also be called Secure File Transfer Protocol. 
		SFTP is an encrypted command-line transfer of files between two systems. This transfer can be done
		through the command-line on your computer, or an SFTP graphical client software can be used to simplify
		the transferring process. SFTP requires the name of the host you are connecting to, as well as a username and password for the host.
		In this tutorial, you will be learning how to download and use the free SFTP software, FileZilla.
